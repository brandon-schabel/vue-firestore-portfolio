# Vue CRUD Firestore Demo

> A simple CRUD demostration using firestore and vue
I tried to make this as simple as possible so instead of following the convention of splitting the Crud component into
mutliple files, I decided to just keep all the functionality in one file.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
